## Covid Report

My analysis uese the data from the national US covid data dealing with cases and deaths in the US. According to my analysis I have found that the total Covid cases up to the most recent date has been 97,287,332. The total number of deaths from Covid in the US has been 1,066,576 people.


I also want to show the chart:

```{r echo=FALSE}
